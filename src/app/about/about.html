  I’m M Baarrun Bin Jamal, born on July 28, 2008. I’m currently enrolled in the ACCP AI course at Aptech, where I’m in my third semester, while also pursuing my second year in Pre-Engineering. I have a strong interest in both software development and technology, with hands-on experience in SQL, MySQL, PHP, Laravel, Angular (with Material UI), HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and jQuery. I also work with C# for console applications, Windows Forms, and game development. In addition to coding, I’m familiar with SEO, WordPress, and GitHub for project management and version control. I’m passionate about continuously learning, building real-world projects, and growing as a full-stack developer with a focus on both web and software solutions.
